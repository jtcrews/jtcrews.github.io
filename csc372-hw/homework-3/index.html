                <h3>Panda Express</h3>
                <p>Location: Bottom floor of fountain view<br>
                    Hours: mon-thurs 11am-9pm, fri: 11am-7pm, sun: 4pm-9pm<br>
                    Right here on campus you can find my personal favorite fast food resturaunt in all it's glory.
                    It's not beloved by all, but I hold a serious sense of nostalgia for this place. I use to only get
                    panda at
                    a mall by my moms work on special occasions when I was a child. Once that mall closed over 10 years
                    ago my oppertunities
                    to enjoy it became less frequent(and they were already very infrequent). Now with the convenience of
                    having it right on
                    cammpus its quickly become my favorite spot to grab a bite.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img class="small" id="rice" src="images/fried-rice.jpg" alt="fried-rice" />
                    <p class="hidden-text">Panda Express’s fried rice is a delicious, flavorful side dish that combines
                        perfectly seasoned
                        rice with a blend of peas, carrots, and scrambled eggs. It's highly recommended for its
                        comforting taste, quick convenience, and the way it always hits the spot!</p>
                    <img class="small" id="orange-chicken" src="images/orange-chicken.jpg" alt="orange-chicken" />
                    <p class="hidden-text">Panda Express’s orange chicken is a crispy, tangy-sweet masterpiece that
                        bursts with bold
                        citrus flavor in every bite. The golden chicken is coated in a sticky, zesty sauce with just the
                        right amount
                        of sweetness and a hint of spice. It’s a fan-favorite for a reason, and it's my personal
                        favorite item on the menu.</p>
                    <img class="small" id="honey-shrimp" src="images/honey-shrimp.jpg" alt="honey-shrimp" />
                    <p class="hidden-text">Panda Express’s honey walnut shrimp is a delightful mix of crispy shrimp
                        coated in a
                        sweet honey glaze and topped with crunchy caramelized walnuts. The perfect balance of sweet and
                        savory,
                        with a hint of nuttiness, makes each bite a treat for your taste buds. It’s a must-try, and a
                        very close second
                        to the classic orange chicken!</p>

                <h3>Chick-fil-A</h3>

                    Hours: mon-thurs: 730am-10pm, fri:730am-8pm, sat: 1030am-6pm<br>
                    What can I say about this classic chicken resturaunt. They invented the chicken sandwhich, and perfected it
                    on their very first attempt! If your looking for a good chicken sandwhich on campus, this is the place.
                    Everyones go to. There also happens to be mutiple Chick-fil-A’s in close proximity too incase this one
                    doesnt have exactly what you're looking for. But remeber, their closed on sundays!
                </p>
                <div class="image-container"></div>
                <img class="small" id="waffle-fries" src="images/waffle-fries.jpg" alt="waffle-fries" />
                <p class="hidden-text">Chick-fil-A’s waffle fries are crispy, golden, and perfectly seasoned, offering
                    the ultimate
                    satisfying crunch in every bite. They’re highly recommended for their addictive flavor, generous
                    portions,
                    and how they’re the perfect side to any Chick-fil-A meal!</p>

                    alt="honey-pepper-pimento-sandwhich" />
                <p class="hidden-text">The honey pepper pimento chicken sandwhich. To put it plain and simple, this is
                    the best chicken sandwhich I have ever eaten. It's
                    a limited time item, go get it, now!
                </p>
                <img class="small" id="tender" src="images/tenders.jpg" alt="chicken-tenders" />
                <p class="hidden-text">Chick-fil-A’s tenders are juicy, hand-breaded perfection, with a crispy exterior
                    and tender,
                    flavorful chicken inside. Each bite is seasoned to perfection, making them an irresistible treat
                    whether you
                    dip them or enjoy them on their own. I will judge you if you don't use sauce, get the polynesian
                    sauce, it's great.</p>
